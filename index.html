              I’m Lyn, the founder of @Shit.You.Really.Need.To.Hear. 
              I created the account during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the uncertainty of the world, my intention was to post quotes that I thought people needed to hear to get them going through their day. I developed an interest to be of service and decided to embark on my coaching journey. I shifted my career from a photographer and a year later, I am now a certified coach, encouraging people to create the life story they want for themselves.

      <p data-width="wide">"You made me a better person overall, I had a hard time asking myself some
         seriously difficult questions and then doing something about it, she helped me open up to myself 
         about the possibilities of what could happen if I actually faced them. And she is such a lovely person,
          I loved talking to her, and listening to what she had to share. I think everyone is looking for 
          that motivation
         in life that can help them test their limits and be better, for me it was her."</p>

      <p data-width="wide"> Lyn was extremely easy to talk to. She made sure that the
         conversation flowed and was an amazing listener. The most impactful part of
          our session was when she pointed out the way I was talking about my future goals. 
          I was talking about them in ‘maybes’, ‘probably’, and ‘I’ll try to as opposed to clearly saying what I’ll do to achieve them. She made me realize that I was already planning not to achieve my goal through my speech. I realized that if I change the way I affirm my process through speaking it can reconfirm
         the achieve-ability of my goal for myself. </p>

      <p data-width="wide">" Lyn showed me how my goals were completely attainable, even if they didn't 
        feel that way, and helped me break them down into actionable steps. Even though I was asking for 
        help with some habits I was pretty embarrassed about, Lyn was incredibly understanding and empathetic. 
        I never once felt judged or guilty and became very comfortable opening up fully to her"</p>

      <p data-width="wide">My goal was to be more productive and manage my time more effectively, 
        Lyn helped me realise patterns that were disturbing or distracting my productivity. 
        It was a wholesome experience to understand and rewire my routine making it more purposeful. 
        I am grateful for the opportunity given by Lyn, 
        as my coaching was handled with care, honesty,  and understanding.</p>
