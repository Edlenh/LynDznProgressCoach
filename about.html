        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-blue poem">Once Upon a Time</h2>
        <p class="poem">there was a girl, called Lyn, who was told...<br> 
          A degree by this age, a job by that <br>
          A house and a spouse, and two furry cats <br>
          A baby by then, and a retirement to plan <br>
          A life lived according to society's grand plan <br>
          
          Everyday, without questioning it,
           she would wake up and accept these given beliefs. <br>
          
          One day…she realised with disbelief, that.. <br>
          Society's timeline, a constant press <br>
          A never-ending stress <br>
          To reach milestones, on schedule and time <br>
          A race that's never-ending, a climb <br>
          
          Because of that… she told herself  <br>
          “No more running, hiding, or fear <br>
          Just living in the moment, my dear <br>
          With every step, I'll pave the way.  <br>
          For a brighter future, come what may” <br>
          
          
          Because of that… <br>
          she created a world of her own, where she is free <br>
          to live her life, wild and carelessly<br>
          Until finally … <br>
          a tale of triumph, and true success<br>
          creating a life story, that she doesn’t need to escape, is the best.

            <h3 class="fs-normal fw-bold">Aware &  Understand</h3>
          <p data-width="wide">Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own thoughts,
             emotions, and behaviors. Being aware of yourself, helps you to recognize and understand the impact of your actions. 
             It's an important quality to have because it allows you to reflect on your own actions and make conscious choices
              about how you want to respond to situations. It also helps you to be more in tune with your own needs and boundaries,
               and to communicate them effectively to others.  By understanding yourself better, you can make informed choices about your life,
                help identify your strengths and weaknesses,
             and make positive changes to improve your well-being.  </p>

            <h3 class="fs-normal fw-bold">Character & Structure</h3>
          <p data-width="wide">This pillar is all about habit formation. Habit formation is important in building your character because it
             helps you to develop consistent patterns of behaviour that can make your life more efficient and effective.
             When we form habits, we don't have to constantly make conscious decisions about how to act in certain situations. 
            Instead, we can rely on our habits to guide our actions, which allows us to save mental energy and focus on other tasks. </p>

            <h3 class="fs-normal fw-bold">Reflect & Resilience</h3>
          <p data-width="wide">Reflection is the process of thinking about and analyzing your experiences and actions. 
            It involves considering what happened, why it happened, and what you can learn from the experience. 
            By analyzing your experiences, you can identify patterns and come up with strategies for dealing with challenges and setbacks. 
            This can help you become more adaptable and better equipped to handle difficult situations.
             When you reflect on your experiences, you can identify areas where you can learn and grow,
             which can help you become more resilient in the face of challenges and setbacks.</p>
